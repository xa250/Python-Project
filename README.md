# Projects 

1. **Ramen Ratings**: I conducted a hypothesis testing and some other statistical analysis to find out the distribution of the ramen ratings around world. 

2. **Distribution for Rolling Dices**: I simulated a 20side dice rolling for different number of times, and trying to prove the ditribution for each side has the equal chance accoridng to the Law of Large Numbers. I aslo wanted to test the likelihood of observing a given mean on a set of 20-sided dice rolls to see if they follow the Central Limit Theorm
